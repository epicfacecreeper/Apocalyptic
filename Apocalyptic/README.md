Apocalyptic
===========

Apocalyptic plugin for Bukkit

Installation
============
Download Apocalyptic.jar and add to your /plugins/ folder.
If you want world generation, add this snippet to the bottom of bukkit.yml.
`
worlds:
  <world>:
    generator: Apocalyptic
`
Where `<world>` is the name of the world you want to generate.

If you use Muiltiverse, run this command to make a new Apocalyptic world.
`/mv create <world> normal -g Apocalyptic`
Again, where <world> is the name of the world you want to generate.

Run the server. This will generate some of the world and create config files. Set up the configuration files to your liking. I am currently working on a configuration guide.

Done! Have fun!
